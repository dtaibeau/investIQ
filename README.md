# investIQ
An automated portfolio tracking system that leverages real-time data streams, natural language processing (NLP), and AI-based trend analysis. This product will empower fund managers and investors to gain insights into market trends, sector performance, and investment opportunities.

_NOTE: This project is currently not deployed, as I do not have the funds to keep paying for the Twitter API :D feel free to explore the code or reach out if you have questions!_
